 Profile Card UI in React.js + TailwindCSS! 🎨⚛️

I’ve been working on sharpening my React component skills, and here’s my latest mini project: a horizontal profile card layout inspired by real-world freelance platforms.

✅ Features:

Clean horizontal layout (profile on left, info on right)

Smooth "View Profile" toggle with extra details

Responsive design with TailwindCSS

Invite + tag-based skills section

Fully customizable and reusable

🔧 Tech stack:
React.js | TailwindCSS | Functional Components | useState

🎯 This is part of my ongoing journey to master component design, layout systems, and modern UI patterns. More components coming soon – badges, modals, dashboards!

💬 I'd love your feedback – What should I build next?
